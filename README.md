The following an optimization project that uses Integer Linear Programming and Meta-heuristics to find solution to problems of increasing complexity.

Specifically, we are using:

* ILP Model
* Heuristics: Greedy + Local Search
* Meta-heuristics: GRASP

Review __ProjectReport.pdf__ for the full report of the project.

I have included the .tex file for those interested.

As expected, there is ample room for improvement, but as an starting point for some students I think it should be Ok.

Best Regards,

Wilmer
